I am thrilled to share the exciting results of Seattle Airbnb 2023 Data Analysis Project in Tableau!

I worked tirelessly to analyze the Seattle Airbnb market for the year 2022 / 2023 , using Tableau to visualize and interpret the data.

Through the analysis, I was able to identify trends and patterns in the Seattle Airbnb market, such as the most popular neighborhoods for tourists and the average prices for listings during peak seasons. These findings can provide valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, travelers in the Seattle market.

I'm excited to share the results!
